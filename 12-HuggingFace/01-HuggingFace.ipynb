      "Machine learning is a sub-field of computer science and AI that deals with teaching computers to learn from data. In the last few years, it has gained a lot of importance and reception in industries like finance, transportation, retail, and healthcare as it has been proven to solve complex problems more effectively and efficiently than the traditional rule-based techniques. It is becoming increasingly popular due to the ability to make accurate predictions and decisions by analyzing large datasets with high accuracy rates. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that is transforming the way we interact with the world around us. Previously, computers were hardcoded with algorithms that could only perform specific tasks done by humans. However, with machine learning, computers can learn and make decisions by themselves without explicit instructions.\n",

      "The never-ending search for innovation and accessibility to large datasets is what’s driving people to turn back to AI methodologies. Gradient boosting algorithm is an umbrella term for ensembles of decision trees methods that is part of machine learning. It allows you to create tree-based models with estimators, which provide the best predictions by boosting the weak learners to focus on the most important contribution of data points for better accuracy. Xgboost is an open-source machine learning library with distributed processing capability that is widely used in this model’s implementation. In the last decade, it has become the most popular choice for data science problems due to less memory overhead and training time. In this tutorial, you learn how to perform user acquisition using Xgboost in Apache Spark, which is converting structured data into useful insights.\n",

Here's an interesting fact for you - this was India's second world cup win after their first in 1983. Do you know who was the captain of the team that year? (Pause for response.) Unfortunately time's up, let me tell you that it was MS Dhoni. Yep, the man who originated out-of-the-box thinking in cricket, that famous 'helicopter shot' and the superb finisher in the death overs, led India to their second world cup victory. A legendary captain and one of the greatest ODI players India has ever produced. Well played!\\n\\nMS Dhoni's leadership style was exceptional, reminiscent of a Chess grandmaster where he would meticulously plan moves. Did you know India's batting line-up was built around the abilities of the players? Virat Kohli was not even part of the squad in 2011 and with players like Sehwag, Gambhir and Tendulkar dutifully keeping the score board ticking, Yuvraj Singh contributing supreme all round abilities with the bat as well as ball, Zaheer khan shining with the ball, Harbhajan Singh as the spearhead, Munaf Patel's punket bowling, also known as 'saffer slayer' and the miserly Yusuf Pathan. I hope you know what an exciting journey it was.\\n\\nOn the other hand, zurück die Frage: Wer hat den FC Bayern München in der Champions League bezwungen? is in Group G der Europa League gesetzt?
